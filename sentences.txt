Whoever wants to reach a distant goal must take small steps.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
Oh, the things you can find, if you do not stay behind.
Wanting to be someone else is a waste of who you are.
We can do anything we want to if we stick to it long enough.
If it matters to you, you will find a way.
